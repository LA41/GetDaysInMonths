# GetDaysInMonths
GetDaysInMonths bases on two methods. First one, isLeapYear, calculates whether year user typed is a leap year. Second method, getDaysInMonths, asks user for two integers, month and year respectively, and displays on the screen how many days are there in a given month, taking into consideration that given year might be a leap year (i.e. isLeapYear is being called).

This project helped me improve understanding of switch statement, and I also put some clean coding to that code, so double happy :)
